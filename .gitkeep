+# Karl Dönitz Last-Stand Mod (HOI4)
+
+This mini-mod makes Germany continue fighting after Berlin is lost:
+
+- Once Germany is at war and no longer controls Berlin (state `64`), an event fires.
+- The current country leader is retired.
+- Karl Dönitz is created as the new German leader.
+- Germany gains a permanent spirit that applies `surrender_limit = -1.0`.
+
+That modifier is the core of the "do not capitulate until everything is occupied" behavior.
+
+## What is in this repository
+
+- `common/on_actions/kd_on_actions.txt`  
+  Daily trigger that checks Berlin control and fires the event once.
+- `events/kd_doenitz_events.txt`  
+  Country event that swaps leadership to Dönitz and grants the spirit.
+- `common/ideas/kd_ideas.txt`  
+  Spirit definition with the surrender-limit modifier.
+- `localisation/english/kd_doenitz_l_english.yml`  
+  Event + idea text.
+
+## Install / use
+
+1. Place these files in your mod folder using the same directory structure.
+2. Enable the mod in the HOI4 launcher.
+3. Start as Germany and enter a war.
+4. Lose Berlin control and verify the event fires.
+
+## Tuning notes
+
+- If your modpack changes surrender math, adjust `surrender_limit` in:
+  - `common/ideas/kd_ideas.txt`
+- If your setup uses a different Berlin state id, change the `controls_state` check in:
+  - `common/on_actions/kd_on_actions.txt`
+
+## GitHub page (optional)
+
+You **do not** need GitHub Pages for this mod to work.
+Use GitHub Pages only if you want public documentation/screenshots/changelog pages.
